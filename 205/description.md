# 205: Isomorphic Strings

**Easy**

Given two strings `s` and `t` , _determine if they are isomorphic_ .

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t` .

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
