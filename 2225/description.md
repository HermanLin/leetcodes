# 2225: Find Players With Zero or One Losses

**Medium**

**Topics**: A,B,C

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winner_i, loser_i]` indicates that the player `winner_i` defeated player `loser_i` in a match.

Return a _list `answer` of size `2` where:_

- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

Note:

- You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
- The testcases will be generated such that **no** two matches will have the **same** outcome.


### Example 1
```
Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
```

### Example 2
```
Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= matches.length <= 10^5`
- `matches[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= winner_i, loser_i <= 10^5`
- `winner_i != loser_i`
- All `matches[i]` are **unique**.
